        <p> I have spent the past few months learning about coding. I have gone through tutorials for Python, SQL, and C++. I still have a lot to learn, but working with these very different languages has given me a <strong>LOT</strong> of insight into the differences that make them unique! </p>
        <p> Working with those tutorials inspired me to learn more at Flatiron School. With their guidance, I have been developing my skills in Javascript, HTML, CSS, and working with Devtools in Google Chrome! </p>
